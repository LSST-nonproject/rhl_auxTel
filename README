You'll have to add
       AUXTEL_DIR/python
(where AUXTEL_DIR is the directory containing this file) to your $PYTHONPATH environment variable.

The easiest way to do this is to use eups and say
       setup -r AUXTEL_DIR

You will need a version of python3, and have numpy installed, then
       cd AUXTEL_DIR/examples
start a jupyter notebook, and run
      AuxTel.ipynb


You will see that I have totally faked SAL, and while I'm sure that I haven't got it write in detail I hope
that the spirit is correct.
